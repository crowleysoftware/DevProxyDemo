### NOTE: some powershell scripts may require PowerShell V7x

The various folders in this repo contain a README and examples that demonstrate a particular topic.
For intance, "RateLimit" contains a devproxy config file crafted specifically to demo the rate limiter plugin and also a powershell script with example requests. 

In each case, running `devproxy` from within the specific folder will use the configuration in that folder.

run the `devproxy` commands from an external terminal if you plan to run the requests.ps1 files from the VS Code terminal. For some reason even if you spin up multiple terminals in VS Code it acts super flaky.
